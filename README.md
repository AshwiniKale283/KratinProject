Developed .NET MVC web application

Problem: How can you help Sunita Sharma (65+ years old) to live a healthier and better life?

Solution: 

"Jivhala Old Age Home" Website

Introduction: 
	There is no denying the fact that in India, there is a lot of stigma and misconceptions associated with old-age homes. The very fact that an elderly person is sent to old age home facilities in India generates a thought that the elderly person is being neglected by his/her family and tossed out of their home.
	On the other hand, in reality, the situation is completely opposite. Old age homes in India are the place where elderly people get every kind of facilities for a great living. They are treated with care and responsibility amidst experienced doctors and caregivers.
	The fact is, old age homes in India, finely serve as the home with safety and security in a much better way for elderly people. 
I have developed a .Net web application that is "Jivhala Old Age Home" website to live old people as like SUNITA SHARMA(+65 years old) ) to live a healthier and better life.

Technology: .NET (MVC based Web Application)

SCREENSHOTS:  I have uplaoded Screenshots pdf in this repository.
